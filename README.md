# Canva Certificate Generator
 Automatically creates a digital certificate for each participant in a webinar/ seminar using Canva.

 Pre-conditions:
 - You must be logged in to Canva and have a working canva link of the certificate template to use this automation project.
 - The template must contain the word "Name" as it is the default target of the initial Type Into activity.
 - If the selectors of the process fails, it might be due to the font used in the template (e.g. script, decorative) but you can always test it out as it has successful attempts on some fonts.
 - You are free to use/ modify this as you want! :)

   ENJOY! ~~
